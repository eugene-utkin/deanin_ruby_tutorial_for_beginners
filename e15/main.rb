# We want a calculator that can do the following:
# 1. Addition.
# 2. Subtraction.
# 3. Multiplication.
# 4. Division.

# It should get user input
# It should print the result

# We also want to continually ask for input.
# A user can do multiple calculations per run.
# A user can quit by typing Q or q.
